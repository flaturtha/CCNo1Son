          <li>Gaze longingly at your bookshelf, <em>wishing you had time to read</em>?</li>
          <li>Cruise the used bookstore, <em>but never buy because there's just no time</em>?</li>
          <li>Kill time waiting for appointments, kids, &hellip; <em>when you could be reading</em>?</li>

        <p>Let's face it, you're busy. Chasing appointments all over town; chasing your kids at practice, from school &amp; activities. You've got work and home commitments all vying for your time. And there's only so many hours in a day.</p>
        <p>That leaves precious little time for yourself; for those little things <em>you</em> want to do. Like read a good book. Or any book. Much less a good murder mystery.</p>
        <p>What little time you do have is spent waiting &hellip; for those kids to get out of activities, for the line to move forward so its your turn, for a meeting to start or a delay-again appointment.</p>
        <h3>What if I told you there was a way to lose yourself in a good murder mystery?</h3>
        <p>That's why you're here, right? 'Cause you're a <em>real</em> murder mystery fan, yeah? Its what brought you to this page and why you've stuck around. You wanna know about that dead body. About the investigator. You want to know who-dun-it. I can help.</p>
        <p>Let me introduce myself. Name's Finn. Well, the whole thing is Michael Thomas Patrick O'Finn but everybody just calls me Finn. I'm a PI.</p>
        <p>I work all kinds of cases but I specialize in literary investigations. Y'know, the kind of murders and investigations that end up splashed all over the pages of some paperback rag. The ones collecting dust on that bookshelf.</p>
        <h3>"So what!?" I can hear you thinking.</h3>
        <p>So what, indeed. What's that mean to a busy guy or gal like you? Simple. I've spent years in the trenches. Sometimes working on my own. Sometimes working with other literary investigators. From that classic sleuth Mr. Sherlock Holmes to that dapper gent Poirot. I knew Spade and Archer. Countless others.</p>
        <p>And I have all their case files. Them and countless other private eyes, police detectives. Even the amateur files. And I want to share them with you.</p>
        <!-- <h3>TalesofMurder.com</h3> -->
        <p>I know. Who cares if I've got access to hundreds of great murder mystery stories? Doesn't free up your time or give you more. I mean, you still gotta find a story. Maybe keep the old paperback in your purse or briefcase. Maybe if you're into 'em, you've got some kind of ebook reader &hellip; Kindle, Nook, some other brand. But you still gotta carry it with you. You gotta dig through catalogs to find a good story. Or any story.</p>
        <h3>Here's where I can help.</h3>
        <p>What's the one thing you carry with you <em>everywhere!</em> I'm talking about that phone. Admit it, you take it with you into the john when you're, well, y'know. Yup. You've got that phone with you when you're waiting for other stuff to happen. Call it a smartphone, mobile phone, whatever. Chances are you pull it out when you've got 32 seconds at the stoplight and check Facebook, Twitter and all those social media sites you're on.</p>
        <p>You pull it out any time you've got a few minutes to kill: while waiting in line; waiting for the doctor to get to you; waiting for your kids &hellip; and you probably just surf or browse the social media sites.</p>
        <h3>But what does <em>that</em> accomplish?</h3>
        <p>Nothin', that's what. You're wasting time aimlessly looking to see what your followers and friends are up to. Be honest. Do you really care?</p>
        <p>Instead, turn your phone into a powerful device to take you away from the daily stress of life into the exciting world of murder mystery fiction.</p>
        <p>That's what <span>TalesofMurder.com</span> is designed to do &hellip;</p>

No, not you. You're a <em>real</em> murder mystery fan and you're clued in. Not like those other stiffs.</p>
        <p>Smiling to yourself, you take out your phone. Or maybe your tablet. Tap. Browser open. Tap bookmarks. Open <span>TalesofMurder.com</span>. The latest story, just posted, pops to the top of your screen. You read the teaser. Maybe its one you wanna read. Maybe not. Thumbing down the screen, you browse a few more teasers. Then &hellip; from the bottom of the screen &hellip; a title scrolls into few. An image appears next to it.</p>
        <p>"Hmmmm," you think to yourself. "A new mystery by [YOUR FAVORITE AUTHOR]."</p>
        <p>You tap the title and there it is. A murder mystery short story displayed simply and perfectly on your screen. You glance casually at the others in the waiting room, fruitlessly pacing, flipping. You smile to yourself again and then you're there &hellip; at the scene of a murder, with a tireless investigator, enjoying a gripping murder mystery!</p>
