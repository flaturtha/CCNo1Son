## We'll see about that &hellip; but, please, come on in. Grab a cold beverage and sit back while I explain what its all about.

**But first, let me introduce myself.** Name's Finn. Well, the whole thing is Michael Thomas Henry McFinnly. But everyone just calls me Finn. I'm a PI and I specialize in literary mysteries &hellip; usually involving a murder.

I've been retain by certain &hellip; uh &hellip; parties to recruit gumshoes for a new murder mystery short story website. Now, it doesn't really matter what *style* of gumshoe you are:

* hardboiled
* gentile amateur sleuth
* a copper on the job
* old timey or modern day

Whatever type of mystery you might be into, we've got your poison.

What my client is building is a multi-genre library of the best murder mystery short stories and serialized novels available anywhere. And each story is designed to be read on whatever web-enabled device you've got handy&mdash;from that smartphone you carry with you *everywhere* to a tablet, laptop, desktop (don't worry, I won't snitch to your boss!), or even that flatscreen and game device if that's what floats your boat.

But here's the kicker &rarr;

### Membership in this little club

Not everybody who applies will be accepted. That's right. My client has a pretty specific list of criteria for its gumshoes. Pretty high standards, ya might say. Let's see if you qualify.

First, you gotta be a legit murder mystery fan. If you're not, well, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Nothin' personal. We just have certain standards.

Second, I need you to run through this little questionaire. Just a formality. Check off any boxes that apply to you. When you're done
