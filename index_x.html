          <li>Gaze longingly at your bookshelf, <em>wishing you had time to read</em>?</li>

        </ul>

    <section class="content">
      <p>Let's face it, you're busy. Chasing appointments all over town. Chasing your kids at practice, from school &amp; activities. You've got obligations. Responsibilities.</p>
      <p>That leaves precious little time for what you <em>want</em> to do. Like read a good book. Or any book. Much less a murder mystery.</p>
      <h3 class="center">What if I told you there was a way to read a good murder mystery?</h3>
      <p>You are a murder mystery fan, right? That's why you came to this site; why you've stuck around as long as you have.</p>
      <p>Let me introduce myself. Name's Finn. Well, the whole thing is Michael Thomas Patrick Finnley but everybody just calls me Finn. I'm a PI.</p>
      <p>I work all kinds of cases, but I specialize in literary investigations. Y'know, the kind of murders that end up splashed across the pages of some paperback rag. And I've collected, with the help of some of my investigator buddies, a few of those stories here at TalesofMurder.com</p>
      <h3 class="center">"Why?" I can here you asking.</h3>
      <p>It's simple. There's more than a couple traincars full of great murder mysteries out there. All kinds. From cozies with little of ladies outwitting society murderers, to hard boiled PIs and on-the-job coppers who chase down crooks, keeping the streets safe for you and me. Well, you. Anyway, any kind of murder mystery story you can imagine. That's what I'm talking about here.</p>
      <p>I've done the dirty work. I've collected the stories. All you have to do is grab whatever device you've got handy&mdash;smartphone, tablet, laptop, deskop at the office (don't worry, I won't snitch to your boss), what-have-you. Then just point your your browswer here and, <em>WHAM</em>, you're reading a murder mystery.</p>
      <p>That's right. Anytime you've got 5 minutes to kill, don't waste it surfing the 'net or endlessly watching your social networks&hellip;those apes are dull anyway! Just log on and find a good story that fits the time you've got.</p>
      <h3 class="center">But there's a catch:</h3>
      <p>You were waiting for that one, huh? Always a catch. Just a fact of life.</p>
      <p>But as catch's go, this one ain't so bad. Just the fact the the main site is still being set up. Yup. UNDER CONSTRUCTION. To be honest, I'm still sorting through the stories.</p>
      <h3 class="center">Hey! Don't get bent outta shape.</h3>
      <p>Fact is, I want to make sure you get the best murder mysteries out there. Not just any mess cobbled together by some jerk who doesn't know his plot from his&hellip;well, y'know the adage. Theses stories will be worth the wait. I promise.</p>
      <p>Look. Quality takes time. Or as my momma says, &#8220;<em>Good</em> quality takes time!&#8221;</p>
      <p>But I'll let ya in on a little secret.</p>
      <p>Lean in a little closer to the screen &hellip; that guy next to ya is trying to see what you're reading.</p>
      <p>Now, I shouldn't be telling you this 'cause its kinda a secret. We don't want every idiot and his brother from finding out so you gotta promise to keep this under your hat.</p>
      <h4>Promise?</h4>

      <p>From now until the site launches on Oct. 15, you can get in on a special deal. Naw! It ain't one of those scams where you invest a bunch of green expecting a big payout. I ain't the mob. Never worked for 'em. Don't like 'em. This is legit. No cash upfront. In fact, I want to give you something just for checking it out.</p>
      <p>Now, I can't devulge the details right here. I mean, this is a public website. And this is just for <em>real</em> murder mystery fans.</p>
